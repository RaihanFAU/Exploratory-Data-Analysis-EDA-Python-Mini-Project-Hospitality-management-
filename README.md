# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-Python-Mini-Project-Hospitality-management
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on hotel booking data to uncover insights into customer booking behaviors, room utilization, and business performance. It combines multiple datasets to analyze trends, patterns, and potential opportunities in hotel management and forecasting.

# Project Objectives
- Clean, transform, and merge multiple datasets related to hotel bookings

Perform EDA to explore:

- Booking trends over time

- Occupancy rates and revenue patterns

- Popular hotels and room types

- Seasonal effects on booking volume

- Visualize key metrics using Python libraries

- Identify data-driven insights for business decisions

# Key Analyses & Visualizations

- Booking trends over months and years

- Hotel-wise and room-type performance

- Revenue and occupancy rate analysis

- Seasonal demand fluctuations

- Comparative analysis using aggregated data

# Data Cleaning Steps

- Handling missing values and duplicates

- Converting date columns to datetime format

- Merging multiple datasets on key dimensions

- Filtering and transforming data for analysis

# Insights (Sample Findings)

- Room type “Deluxe” generates the highest revenue across most hotels.

- Peak bookings occur between June and August.

- Certain hotels show low occupancy in off-season months.

- Average length of stay is 2.4 days.
